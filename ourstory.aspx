                    In this regard, our team conducts regular awareness programs for dairy farmers – 
                    Godhani Chaupal – where trained veterinary, and animal feed experts counsel farmers on animal feed, animal health & other related aspects. We also celebrate Milk Day, Women’s Day, Veterinary Day, among many other important occasions. Additionally, we organize factory visits and animal welfare camps to provide our dairy farmers with a more practical, hands-on learning experience.</p>
